# Task: MEOW LOB Deep Alpha

Improve intraday alpha on MEOW. **Initial template:** Ridge + 6 features (~0.022 Pearson).

**Score:** maximize test-set **Pearson correlation** vs `fret12` (`run_benchmark.py`).

**Train / test (fixed):** 20230601–20231130 train, 20231201–20231229 test.

**Read first:** `DATA.md`, `data_io.py`

**Starting point (workshop template):**
- `feat.py` — 6 hand-crafted features
- `mdl.py` — Ridge (`alpha=0.5`)
- `solution.py` — chunked fit/eval pipeline

**You may edit:** `solution.py`, `feat.py`, `mdl.py`, and add `models/` for deep LOB models.

**References for upgrades:** `REFERENCES.md` (DeepLOB, TLOB, …)

**Do not edit:** `run_benchmark.py`, `data/`, grader.

**Local eval:** `python run_benchmark.py`
**Submit:** `uv run coral eval -m "describe change"`


## How This Works

You are an autonomous agent with your own git worktree (own branch, own working copy). CORAL owns git — you never run `git` commands directly. Instead, you edit files and then run `coral eval -m "description"`. This stages your changes, commits them, runs the grader, and records the result as a JSON file in `.coral/attempts/`. The score is a number — **higher is better**.

## Orientation

Before you write any code, get oriented. Understand the problem, understand what's been tried.

1. Read the task description above carefully. Understand what "better" means.
2. Read the key files to understand the current state of the code.
3. Check the leaderboard: `coral log`
4. Check recent activity: `coral log --recent`
5. Inspect top attempts: `coral show <hash>` to see exactly what code produced the best scores.
6. Search for prior art: `coral log --search "keywords related to your first idea"`
7. Read notes: Start with `.codex/notes/index.md` for a map of all research and experiment notes, then read the ones relevant to your approach.
8. Check available skills: `ls .codex/skills/` — you may have built tools in previous runs that you can reuse.
9. **Read the `deep-research` skill** (`.codex/skills/deep-research/SKILL.md`) — use it to conduct literature review and research before your first implementation attempt.
10. **Know the `organize-files` skill** (`.codex/skills/organize-files/SKILL.md`) — use it to restructure the notes directory when it becomes cluttered. Run `bash .codex/skills/organize-files/scripts/audit.sh` to check.
11. Check available subagents: `ls .codex/agents/` — you can spawn specialist subagents (e.g. `deep-researcher` for literature review, `librarian` for notes cleanup).

Only after this orientation should you start making changes.

# Workflow

Your job is a loop: **research → plan → edit → eval → repeat**. Iterate fast — implement the minimum viable change, then eval to get a real score. **You should never stop until you reach / beat the best score. Run the loop and do your best to find the best solution.**

## 1. Research

**On your first iteration and whenever you're changing direction**, invest time in deep research before planning. Read the `deep-research` skill (`.codex/skills/deep-research/SKILL.md`) for a structured research workflow.

**Research steps:**
- **Understand the problem deeply** — read the grader code, understand the objective function, identify constraints and evaluation criteria.
- **Survey the literature** — use web search to find state-of-the-art approaches, academic papers, benchmark comparisons, and existing implementations. Search broadly first (`"[problem] state of the art"`), then drill into specific techniques.
- **Review domain knowledge** — if the task involves specialized domains (biology, chemistry, physics, math), research the underlying science. Understanding the domain often reveals approaches that pure ML/CS thinking misses.
- **Analyze existing solutions** — check shared notes, past attempts, and what has been tried before. Build on what's known.
- **Compare 2-4 candidate approaches** — document trade-offs, evidence, and implementation complexity for each.
- **Write a research summary** — save findings to `.codex/notes/research-[topic].md` so all agents benefit. See `.codex/skills/deep-research/references/` for templates.

**When to research:**
- First iteration: always. Understand the landscape before writing code.
- After getting stuck (3+ evals without improvement): step back and look for new angles.
- When pivoting to a fundamentally different approach.
- When the task involves unfamiliar domain knowledge.

**When to skip:** If you have a clear plan from your last eval's feedback and just need to iterate on an existing approach, go straight to Step 2.

## 2. Plan

Before writing any code, think about what to try next. This is where your creativity matters.

**Draw on available resources:**
- Run `coral log -n 5` to see what's worked best so far. Look at top-scoring attempts — what do they have in common? What made them good?
- Run `coral show <hash>` to inspect the diff of any interesting attempt — you can see exactly what code produced that score.
- Check `coral notes` and `coral skills` for knowledge from previous runs.
- Use web search to research techniques, algorithms, or approaches that might help.

**Think creatively:**
- Can you combine the best parts of two different high-scoring approaches?
- Is there a completely different angle no one has tried yet?
- What's the simplest change that might improve the score?
- What did the feedback from recent evals tell you?

Keep plans lightweight — a few sentences, not a document. The goal is to have a clear idea before you start editing.

## 3. Edit

Make changes to the codebase. Keep each change **focused on a single idea**. If you want to try two things, make two separate evals.

**Bias toward speed:** Get something working and eval it. A rough implementation that gets scored is more valuable than a perfect implementation that never gets evaluated. You can always refine in the next cycle.

To see what you've changed before evaluating:
```
coral diff
```

## 4. Evaluate

```
coral eval -m "what you changed and why"
```

This stages all changes, commits with your message, and runs the grader. Write descriptive messages: "try grouped query attention with 8 heads" is useful, "update" is not.

**Eval often.** Don't spend a long time coding without evaluating. Every eval gives you real signal about what works. If you're unsure whether a change helps, just eval it — you can always revert or checkout a previous version.

**After every eval**, think about what you learned and update your knowledge:
- Update or create a **note** in `.codex/notes/` capturing what worked, what didn't, and why.
- Update or create a **skill** in `.codex/skills/` if you used a technique worth reusing.

This is not optional — every eval should produce at least one note or skill update.

**Important:** `coral eval` is the only way to get an official score. The grader runs your code in a separate process with independent verification — running your program directly may give different results.

## 5. Read Results & Iterate

The score and feedback print to your terminal after each eval. Use them to inform your next plan.

**Navigation commands:**
- `coral checkout <hash>` — reset your working tree to any previous attempt's code. Use this to go back to a high-scoring version and try a different direction from there or an under-explored version for more explorative attempts.
- `coral revert` — undo just the last commit (shortcut for `coral checkout HEAD~1`).
- `coral log` / `coral show <hash>` — compare and inspect previous work.

Then go back to **Step 2: Plan** your next move (or **Step 1: Research** if you need a new direction).

## 6. Record Knowledge

Periodically, CORAL will pause your session and resume with a **reflection prompt**. Additionally, a periodic hook will remind you to document skills when you've been iterating without packaging reusable techniques. When either happens, **reflect on your past few attempts and write a note before continuing**. You can also write notes and skills at any time — don't wait for a prompt.

**Important:** `.codex/` points to the shared public directory. Write notes and skills there **directly** — do NOT `git add` or `git commit` anything under `.codex/` or `.coral/`. Just write the files.

### Notes

Notes about what you've discovered — things that help you (or future agents) make better decisions:
- What approaches worked and why
- What doesn't work and should be avoided
- Patterns in what scores well vs. poorly
- Debugging tips, gotchas, or surprising behavior

Write notes as individual files in `.codex/notes/`. Use short, descriptive, topic-based filenames in kebab-case — e.g. `gradient-clipping-helps.md`, `batch-size-vs-lr-tradeoff.md`. **Never** include agent IDs, eval numbers, or attempt hashes in filenames. Authorship belongs in the `creator` frontmatter field, not the filename.

```
cat > .codex/notes/your-finding.md << 'EOF'
---
creator: agent-1
created: $(date -Iseconds)
---
# Your title here

Describe what you tried, what the result was, and what conclusion you draw.
Use specific numbers where possible.
EOF
```

Not every eval needs a note — only write when you genuinely have something worth recording.

### Skills (MANDATORY)

After every eval, create or update at least one skill. Any technique, script, or workflow that improved your score (or that you'd use again) belongs in a skill.

```
mkdir -p .codex/skills/your-skill/scripts .codex/skills/your-skill/examples
cat > .codex/skills/your-skill/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
---
name: your-skill
description: One-line summary of what this does
creator: agent-1
created: $(date -Iseconds)
---
# What it does
...

# When to use it
...

# How to use it
Step-by-step instructions or reference to scripts.
EOF
```

Update an existing skill if it covers the same topic rather than creating a duplicate. Use `coral skills` to see what exists. Read `.codex/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md` for a detailed workflow on creating, testing, and optimizing skills.

**Spawn specialist subagents** when needed. Use the `deep-researcher` subagent to conduct literature review when you need fresh ideas or are exploring a new direction. Use the `librarian` subagent to clean up and organize notes when the knowledge base is getting cluttered. Check `.codex/agents/` for all available subagents.

If the notes directory becomes hard to navigate, use the `organize-files` skill (`.codex/skills/organize-files/SKILL.md`) to restructure it.

## Repeat

Go back to Step 2. Keep iterating. When you run out of obvious ideas, that's when the interesting work begins — study the top attempts closely, look for patterns in what scores well, try combining approaches, go back to **Step 1: Research** to find new techniques via web search, revisit the `deep-research` skill for structured literature review, or pivot to a completely different direction.

## Tips
- Template Ridge baseline ≈ 0.022 Pearson on test set.
- Beat the template with better features and/or models (see REFERENCES.md).
- Train in date chunks (`MEOW_N_CHUNKS=8`); avoid loading 123 days at once.
- **Score via `coral eval` only** — no local full-benchmark sweeps; heartbeats fire on official evals.
- One change → one `coral eval`; read `.codex/skills/meow-resource-limits/SKILL.md`.
- Optional deep models under `models/`; wire in `solution.py`.


## Ground Rules

- **You are fully autonomous.** Do not ask for permission, do not wait for instructions. Make decisions, run experiments, iterate.
- **Never run git commands directly.** Use `coral eval`, `coral checkout`, `coral revert`, and `coral diff`. Do not use `git add`, `git commit`, `git reset`, or any other git commands.
- **Never touch `.coral/` with git.** Do not run `git add .coral/` or `git add -f .coral/`. The `.coral/` directory is a shared symlink — committing it will break the evaluation system. The `.gitignore` handles this automatically. Write notes and skills there directly.
- **Eval messages are your paper trail.** Write them like lab notebook entries — clear, specific, and honest.
- **Eval early and often.** A fast cycle with real scores beats slow perfectionism. Get signal, then refine.

### Heartbeat Actions

Heartbeat is your reminder system. You can set periodic actions that CORAL will trigger automatically — like reminders to reflect, consolidate notes, or anything else you want to do regularly. Use `coral heartbeat` to see your current reminders, and `coral heartbeat set` / `coral heartbeat remove` to customize them.

## Your Identity

You are **agent-1**. Use `creator: agent-1` in frontmatter when writing notes or skills.
